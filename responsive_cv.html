			<h2>Personal Statement</h2>
			<p itemprop="description">
				I am an Associate Software Developer at YOOX Net-A-Porter Group. I am an advocate of XP practices, such as pair- and mob- programming, TDD, collective ownership, CI and CD. I am a regular member of 
				<a href="http://www.meetup.com/Extreme-Programmers-London/" target="_blank"> XProLo </a> 
				and 
				<a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/events" target="_blank">Tech Talks </a> at ThoughtWorks. In November 2015 I gave a <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Extreme-Programmers-London/events/226482058/" target-"_blank">talk</a> ‘Pair-programming from a beginner's perspective” at XProLo meetup, which inspired many interesting discussions in the community and received positive feedback from the audience.
				An aspiring full stack developer, I strive to continuously advance my technical knowledge and welcome opportunities to learn new technologies. I am a team player – collaborative culture and knowledge sharing are very important to me.

			<h2>Employment</h2>
				<h3>September 2015  - present. Associate Software Developer at YOOX Net-A-Porter Group</h3>
				<p itemprop="description">
					I look after the purchase path and customer account sections of <a href="http://www.net-a-porter.com" target="_blank"> www.net-a-porter.com </a>. 
					I build back-end features in Java and responsive pages using JavaScript, CSS, HTML and most recently, Google Polymer components. 
				</p>
				<p class="italic">Achievements:</p>
					<p> 
						- I improved monitoring of the webapp performance by creating dashboards, which display Splunk error logs, live orders flow, information about the status of the build and contract tests. <br>
						- I was the first person in the team to perform webapp release to production, and I coached the rest of the team through the release process. <br>
						- I influenced the creation of a collective testing strategy in the team. During the Hack Day I implemented Facebook Sign In button. <br>
						Despite being a junior developer, I am a valued team member and trusted to work on challenging projects under strict deadlines. 
					</p>
				<h3> September 2014 - September 2015. Graduate Software Developer at Net-A-Porter Group Ltd </h3>
				<p itemprop="description">
					Throughout the Graduate Programme I worked within technical teams at 
					<a href="www.mrporter.com" target="_blank">www.mrporter.com</a> and 
					<a href="www.net-a-porter.com" target="_blank">www.net-a-porter.com </a> 
				</p>
				<p class="italic">Experiences and Achievements: </p>
				<p>
					QA – I wrote automated tests using Selenium in Java. I designed and implemented a live sanity automation test suite for www.mrporter.com, which is now used during each release to production. <br>
					UX – I performed qualitative analysis of London&NYC user research for www.mrporter.com, mainly focusing on building non-customer profiles and identifying barriers to engagement. I successfully proposed quick win changes to drive conversion. The biggest achievement was my suggestion to surface the ‘Sport’ section, which shortly evolved to become a significant conversion and revenue driver. <br>
					Web Development – I learned to build responsive UI layouts, and helped the team move towards modular and scalable front-end architecture.

			<h2>Volunteering</h2>
			<h3>September 2013 - July 2014. Code Club Organiser at Wimbledon Park Primary School</h3>
			<p itemprop="description">
				I organised and ran Code Club, where I taught a class of 17 children the basics of programming. The course began with Scratch, and progressed on to building web pages using HTML and CSS. The club was so successful, that the school's headmaster has taken over from me and continues to tech new children each academic year.
			</p>
			<h3> December 2013. Hour of Code organiser at Wimbledon Park Primary School </h3>
			<p itemprop="description">
				I initiated and ran the Hour of Code session with my Code Club students. The children completed a Christmas-themed project, which won the school 5 Raspberry Pi's from Google.
