			<h2>Personal Statement</h2>
			<p itemprop="description">
				I am an Associate Software Developer at YOOX Net-A-Porter Group. I am an advocate of XP practices, such as pair- and mob- programming, TDD, collective ownership, CI and CD. I am a regular member of XProLo and Tech Talks at ThoughtWorks. In November 2015 I gave a talk ‘Pair-programming from a beginner's perspective” at XProLo, which inspired many interesting discussions in the community.
				An aspiring full stack developer, I continuously advance my technical knowledge and welcome opportunities to learn new technologies. I am a team player – collaborative culture and knowledge sharing are very important to me.

			<h2>Employment</h2>
				<h3>September 2015  - present. Associate Software Developer at YOOX Net-A-Porter Group</h3>
				<p itemprop="description">
					I look after the purchase path and customer account sections of www.net-a-porter.com. I build back-end features in Java and responsive pages using JavaScript, CSS, HTML and most recently, Google Polymer components. <br>
					Achievements: 
					I improved monitoring of the webapp performance by creating dashboards, which display Splunk error logs, information about live orders, status of the build and contract tests. I was the first person in the team to release my code to production, and I coached the rest of the team through the release process and monitoring. I influenced the creation of a collective testing strategy in the team. During the Hack Day I implemented Facebook Signin button. <br>
					Despite being a junior member of the team, I am a valued member and trusted to work on challenging projects under strict deadlines. 
				</p>
				<h3> September 2014 - September 2015 - Graduate Software Developer at Net-A-Porter Group Ltd </h3>
				<p itemprop="description">
					During the Graduate Programme I worked within technical teams at www.mrporter.com and www.net-a-porter.com
					Experiences and Achievements: <br>
					QA – I wrote automated tests using Selenium in Java. I designed and implemented a live sanity automation test suite for www.mrporter.com, which is now used during each release to production. <br>
					UX – I performed qualitative analysis of London&NYC user research for www.mrporter.com, mainly focusing on building non-customer profiles and identifying barriers to engagement. I successfully proposed quick win changes to drive conversion. The biggest achievement was my suggestion to surface the ‘Sport’ section, which shortly evolved to become a significant conversion and revenue driver. <br>
					Web Development – I learned to build responsive UI layouts, and helped the team move towards modular and scalable front-end architecture.
